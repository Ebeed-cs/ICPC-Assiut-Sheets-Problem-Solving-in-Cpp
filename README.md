## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to solving various problem sheets and challenges to improve your problem-solving skills using C++. It includes a wide range of problems from beginner to advanced levels.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
ICPC Assuit Sheets Problem Solving in Cpp/
│   ├──Assuit Sheets link
│   │   ├── link     
│   ├── sheet1/
│   │   ├── problem1.cpp
│   │   ├── problem2.cpp
│   │   └── ...

```

- `problem_sheets/`: Contains subdirectories for each problem sheet. Each subdirectory includes the problem name
  and their corresponding solutions , the problem statements found in the link in directory "Assuit sheets link"

## How to Use

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ebeed-cs/ICPC-Assiut-Sheets-Problem-Solving-in-Cpp.git
   

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```sh
   cd ICPC-Assiut-Sheets-Problem-Solving-in-Cpp

3. Explore the problem sheets:

   Open the "Assuit sheets link" directory and acess the link to find different problem sheets , and their solutions in the subdirectories organized.

4.Run the solutions: 

You can compile and run the C++ files using a C++ compiler. 
For example:
```sh
g++ -o output sheet1/problem1.cpp
./output

```
